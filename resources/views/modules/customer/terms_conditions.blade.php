                        </div>
                        <h3>REVIEWS, COMMENTS, COMMUNICATIONS, AND OTHER CONTENT</h3>
                        <div>
                            You may post reviews, comments, photos, videos, and other content; send e-cards and other communications; and submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions, or other information, so long as the content is not illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights (including publicity rights), or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable, and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of "spam" or unsolicited commercial electronic messages. You may not use a false e-mail address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of a card or other content.

                        <h3>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COMPLAINTS</h3>
                        <div>
                            DIL.AFRICA respects the intellectual property of others.
                        </div>
                        <h3>RISK OF LOSS</h3>
                        <div>
                            For orders that require shipment using third parties, such purchases from DIL.AFRICA are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.
                        </div>
                        <h3>RETURNS, REFUNDS AND TITLE</h3>
                        <div>
                            DIL.AFRICA does not take title to returned items until the item arrives at our center. At our discretion, a refund may be issued without requiring a return. In this situation, DIL.AFRICA does not take title to the refunded item. 
                        </div>
                        <h3>PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS</h3>
                        <div>
                            DIL.AFRICA attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, DIL.AFRICA does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of any DIL.AFRICA Service is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by DIL.AFRICA itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition.
                        </div>
                        <h3>PRICING</h3>
                        <div>
                            "List Price" means the suggested retail price of a product as provided by a manufacturer, supplier, or seller. We regularly check List Prices against prices recently found on DIL.AFRICA and other retailers. Certain products may have a "Was Price" displayed, which is determined using recent price history of the product on DIL.AFRICA.
<br/>With respect to items sold by DIL.AFRICA, we cannot confirm the price of an item until you order. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If the correct price of an item sold by DIL.AFRICA is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Other merchants may follow different policies in the event of a mispriced item.
<br/>We generally do not charge your credit card until after your order has entered the shipping process or, for digital products, until we make the digital product available to you.

                        </div>
                        <h3>APP PERMISSIONS</h3>
                        <div>
                           When you use apps created by DIL.AFRICA, such as the DIL.AFRICA App, you may grant certain permissions to us for your device. Most mobile devices provide you with information about these permissions. 
                        </div>
                        <h3>OTHER BUSINESSES</h3>
                        <div>
                           Parties other than DIL.AFRICA operate stores, provide services or software, or sell product lines through the DIL.AFRICA Services. In addition, we may provide links to the sites of affiliated companies and certain other businesses. If you purchase any of the products or services offered by these businesses or individuals, you are purchasing directly from those third parties, not from DIL.AFRICA. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant, the offerings of any of these businesses or individuals (including the content of their Web sites). DIL.AFRICA does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product, and content of all these and any other third parties. You should carefully review their privacy statements and other conditions of use.

The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction and enforced in accordance with the Arbitration Act 1995 Chapter No. 4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, DIL.AFRICA reserves the right to pursue the protection of intellectual property rights and confidential information through injunctive or other equitable relief through competent courts.
<br/><strong>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.</strong>  We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
